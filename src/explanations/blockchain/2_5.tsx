                As we’ve seen, most of these alternative protocols employ some type of pay-to-play scheme. Proof of capacity is no different, but here you &apos;pay&apos; with hard drive space. The more hard drive space you have, the better your chance of mining the next block and earning the block reward.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Prior to mining in a proof-of-capacity system, the algorithm generates large data sets known as &apos;plots&apos;, which you store on your hard drive. The more plots you have, the better your chance of finding the next block in the chain.
