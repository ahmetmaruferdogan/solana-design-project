            <strong>Proof of burn</strong>
            
            <p>
                With proof of burn, instead of pouring money into expensive computer equipment, you &apos;burn&apos; coins by sending them to an address where they are irretrievable. By committing your coins to never-never land, you earn a lifetime privilege to mine on the system based on a random selection process.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Depending on how proof of burn is implemented, miners may burn the native currency or the currency of an alternative chain, like bitcoin. The more coins you burn, the better chance you have of being selected to mine the next block.
