            <strong>Bitcoin Bug</strong>
            <br/>
            <p>It&apos;s an attack that lets someone change the unique ID of a bitcoin transaction before it is confirmed on the bitcoin network. The change makes it possible for someone to pretend that a transaction didn&apos;t happen, if all the right conditions are in place.</p>
