            <p>
                A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database:
                Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed,
                which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.
            </p>
        </div>
